            On that date, the whole world is informed about the importance of
            preserving and caring for our oceans, as well as the negative impact
            that humans have on them.
            <br />
            Campaigns and projects are created to generate more solidarity in
            the population.

            The best way to help is by conserving, and avoiding throwing garbage
            in inappropriate places.
            <br />
            Avoiding water waste is extremely important, only 3% of all water on
            the planet is fresh water.

            economy, the oceans are being degraded. Currently, there are studies
            that show that approximately 13 tons of plastic reach the ocean
            every year. This plastic is often ingested by marine fauna, such as
            fish and turtles, and other animals such as birds that feed on fish,
            causing the death of 100,000 marine animals a year, in addition to
            other damage.</span
